# Resources — I asked Claude Code to make me as much money as possible

The four upgrades that turn Claude Code into a money-making business partner instead of an agreeable assistant.

## Files in this folder
- **roast-SKILL.md** — Upgrade 1. The `/roast` skill: convenes a 5-persona council (Contrarian, Expansionist, Logician, Researcher, Buyer) that attacks your idea from every angle, then a Judge returns one GO / RESHAPE / KILL verdict plus the cheapest 48-hour test to de-risk it. Drop it in `.claude/skills/roast/` and run `/roast <your idea>`.
- **session-handoff-SKILL.md** — Upgrade 3. The `/session-handoff` skill: produces a structured end-of-session summary (decisions, shipped changes, key files, running state, verification, deferrals, open questions) so you can `/clear` and pick up in a fresh window with zero context rot. Drop it in `.claude/skills/session-handoff/`.

## The four upgrades
1. **Stop the agreement** — use `/roast` to kill AI sycophancy before you build the wrong thing.
2. **Make it check its own work** — verify on the build (Playwright CLI screenshots, definition of done) and stress-test after (headed browser, malformed inputs) so "finished" actually means "working."
3. **Manage your context** — `/context` to see what's eating the window, `/session-handoff` instead of `/compact`, start fresh past ~250K tokens.
4. **Stop being the bottleneck** — parallel sub-agents for independent work + `/goal` (with a separate evaluator model grading "done") to run autonomously.
